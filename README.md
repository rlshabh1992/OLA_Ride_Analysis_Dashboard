Optimizing ride patterns and revenue insights is crucial for improving operational efficiency in ride-hailing services. To explore this, I built an Ola Rider Analysis Dashboard using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, focusing on key performance metrics and customer behavior.

🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Problem Statement: Analyzed ride patterns, revenue, and customer behavior to optimize operational efficiency.

✅ Conclusion: Identified key trends in rider behavior, peak demand times, and revenue distribution to enhance decision-making.
✅ Tools & Skills Used: Excel, SQL, Power BI (Data Cleaning, Transformation, Visualization, Dashboard Creation).

This dashboard provides actionable insights to improve decision-making for ride-hailing platforms. Looking forward to connecting with professionals in the data analytics space! 🚀
